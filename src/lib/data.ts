With a background as Software Architect at Svenska Spel and several years as consultant/tech lead (including assignments for Södra), I combine strategic perspective with the ability to drive change and results in everyday operations.\n\nI lead with trust, clarity and responsibility — and place great emphasis on visualization, communication and mentorship to help teams and organizations grow.",
